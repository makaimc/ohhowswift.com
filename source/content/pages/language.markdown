### Optionals
* [Switches and optionals](https://thatthinginswift.com/switch-unwrap-shortcut/)  explains why optionals are a good fit for reducing the clunkiness in code
  around variables that may or may not have a value.


### Structs


### Classes


### Function Currying
*Function currying* is a concept Swift brings in from functional programming. 
Curried functions rewrite an existing function with multiple arguments into 
a new function with a single parameter as input and a function as returned
output.

* There is a solid 
  [language-agnostic Stack Overflow post on curried functions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36314/what-is-currying)
  that defines what they are and shows their background comes from algebra
  functions.

* [Curried functions in Swift](http://ijoshsmith.com/2014/06/09/curried-functions-in-swift/)
  provides a concrete simple example of a curried function versus using a
  default parameter value.

* This post explains that 
  [Instance Methods are Curried Functions in Swift](http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-instance-methods-curried-functions/)
  and provides an example of how using function currying in some cases leads
  to cleaner code than in Objective-C.
